Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

The purpose of a flywheel is to be able to rotate BB-8 in-place, but in order
to do so efficiently, it must have lots of mass.  This requires a container to
hold lead weight that attaches to a rotating device called a lazy susan, or
turntable.

For my 300mm diameter turntable, there are 6 holes on the inner ring, which
are used to attach the container. This is convienent since it allowed me to
design one-sixth of the entire container and then print copies. Unfortunately,
one of these holes is not centered like the rest which is why there is an
additional file for that specific portion.

My flywheel is designed to hold 4 pounds of lead, which is about 300 cubic
centimeters.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

The design is inspired by James Bruton's (XRobots) work on his BB-8 Version
3, but is my own creation.

Flywheel.123dx:  One-sixth of the entire flywheel.
FlywheelError.123dx:  The matching container for the one faulty portion
FlywheelTemplates.123dx:  2D templates for designing the container shape

FlywheelPart1.stl:  Three identical containers
FlywheelPart2.stl:  Two containers identical to Part1, plus the faulty
	container, which is the one on the right.
