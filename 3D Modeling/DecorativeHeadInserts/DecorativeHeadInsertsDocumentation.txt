Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

The decorative parts for the head were designed (either by me or the BB-8
Builder's Club) to be the actual visible size on the real BB-8.  With my
head, though, I have no good way of attaching those parts to the head.
These inserts are superglued onto those parts and provide a much larger
contact area to attach them to the inside of the head.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

Everything here is my own creation.
