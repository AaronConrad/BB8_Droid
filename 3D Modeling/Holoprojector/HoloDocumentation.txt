Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

The holoprojector on BB-8's head has two purposes in my project. The first
is to hold a Maxbotix EV0 Ultrasonic Sensor. The second is to have a
removable, clear(ish) dome that LEDs can shine through giving the appearance
of a working projector (and also disengages the sensor).

I decided on using three 5050 RGB LEDs to allow for a range of colors. Their
wires are 30-gauge and must be threaded through one of the sensor's two M3
size mounting holes. The other hole will hold a screw, creating a mechanical
connection between the projector and sensor.

As the version number increases, I get closer to the final design, i.e. the
versions are not interchangeable. The final creation in each version (a dome
and main body for each) is isolated from the work material. The notes below
on each version only list the changes from the version preceeding it.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

*** The main holoprojector is not my design. It was created by the BB-8
Builder's Club, and I take no credit for it. Everything else is my creation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1:
Dome -	18mm diameter
	3 6mm x 6mm x 2mm LED spots
	inside ring for wire - 16mm dia outside, 7.2mm dia inside, 1.5mm height
Sensor-	Block: 22.5mm x 20.3mm x 8mm
	Screw holes: 3mm dia, protrude 2mm
	Cylinder: 16.8 dia
Main Body otherwise unaffected

Version 2:
Dome -	20mm diameter
Sensor-	Extended bottom to accomodate scaled main body
	Extended screw holes by 5mm up
Main Body scaled by 1.11

Version 3:
Dome -	No change
Sensor-	Replaced 3mm screw hole on short side with 2.8mm hole
	Extended block on long side by 1.5mm to better accomodate pins and wires

Version 4 - HoloFinal1.0.stl:
Dome -	Increased depth of LED spots by 0.5mm to allow space for wires
Sensor-	Added wire pass-through for LEDs

Version 5 - HoloFinal2.0.stl:
Dome -	Completely removed spots for LEDs and instead hollowed out an entire
	section to better fit a PCB and its LEDs
Sensor-	Removed pass-through for LEDs and increased tolerances to allow easier
	fitting of the sensor. The result is a better looking, easier to use
	holoprojector

***HoloMount***
I wanted the holoprojector to become removeable in the case that I couldn't
thread the LED wires past the ultrasonic sensor which would mean I'd need to
have swappable holoprojectors. Making it removeable means I can add different
functionality later on if desired.

The mount is simply a ring just slightly smaller on the inside than my
modified holoprojector to allow it to fit snuggly. Then there is a backing
ring for the projector to sit on and allow any necessary wires to thread
through.
