Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

I originally had the flywheel attached to the main axle using a long,
straight bracket, located in the InternalBrackets folder.  I designed a new
bracket to be able to attach to the flywheel with two screws, and to easily
attach other pieces, such as motor brackets.  Also, if I want to adjust the
flywheel height, I don't have to reprint every piece.
