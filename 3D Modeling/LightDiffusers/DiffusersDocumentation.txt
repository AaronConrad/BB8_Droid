Purpose:	Provide descriptions of my 3D print designs

The LEDs I'm using are smaller than some of the lights on the body of BB-8.
To help spread out the light to fill the whole space, I made diffusers that
are printed in a clear filament. To keep the look consistent, I had to make
a diffuser for every light.  I also made the diffusers large enough to be
able to hold the soldered connections in-place to prevent breakage.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

Everything here is my creation.
