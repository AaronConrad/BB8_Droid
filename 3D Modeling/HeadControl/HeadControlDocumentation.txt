BB-8's head can move in all directions against the top of the ball, which
requires a way to move in two axes. This motion can be accomplished with
multiple servos. But by using a ball-and-socket joint, I can accomplish it
with two servos mounted close to the center axis.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

The original ball-and-socket joint is available from Thingiverse at this
URL: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:70366

Everything else is my creation.
Note that the .123dx file includes the designs of the parts in both
STL files.

***HeadControlBallandSocket.stl***
I found a ball-and-socket joint that someone else made and scaled it to a
better size. The socket had its platform trimmed to be able to attach it
easier to the bracket. The ball had its entire platform removed, and
partially hollowed out to fit a 5/8 inch dowel rod that will extend to the
magnets.

***HeadControlBrackets.stl***
The ball-and-socket joint needs to be mounted onto the axle in the center on
top of a PVC T-connector. Each half of the bracket has a small diameter hole
on one end for the pipe, and a larger hole for the T-connector. Then there
is a flat piece that bridges the two and provides a platfrom for the socket
piece to attach to.
