Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

Some of the parts, especially involving the main axle, need a high degree of
precision that I can't get with wood and the power tools I have available.
These parts need to bear a fairly hefty weight, so they are thick and will
be printed with greater infill.

The parts will be described based on which STL file they are in, since that
is the order in which I designed and printed them.

These files (except for one) were built with Autodesk 123D Design, which is a
free application. The AxleBracketCylinder was built with Maya, Education
edition because I couldn't figure out how to make that particular shape in
123D.

Everything here is my creation.

*** BracketsPart1.STL ***
Includes AxleBracket and TopPlatformBracket.

The AxleBracket is attached to opposite sides of the main body sphere and
holds a 1/2 inch PVC pipe between them. Since all the internal weight rests
on these two brackets, it was designed with a large contact area and is
thick. The bottom is curved to match the curvature of the sphere, and also
has tunnels for wires to lights. One of the brackets also has a mount for a
MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyro.

The TopPlatformBracket holds the wood platform on which rests most of the
electronics. Two of these are neccessary, though they will only hold a
portion of the total weight. These brackets have a #8 screw hole attaching
it to two metal corner braces that are screwed to the platform.
