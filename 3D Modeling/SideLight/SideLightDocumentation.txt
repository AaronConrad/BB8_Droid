Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

I was not satisfied with the BB-8 Builder Club's panel light on the side of
his head, so I decided to make my own.  Based off reference images, I think
the panel looks similar to an HDMI port, but with rounded edges.  It was a
quick build, so only 1 version was made.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

Everything here is my own creation.
