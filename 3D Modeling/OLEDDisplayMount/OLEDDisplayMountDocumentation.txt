Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

This piece is designed to go next to the BB-8's "mouthpiece" where the two
cutouts that have lights are. It is compatible with Adafruit's 1.27" OLED
full color display. I've made the two cutouts larger than the actual BB-8
in order to use more of the screen space.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

Everything here is my own creation.
