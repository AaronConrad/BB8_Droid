Purpose:	Provide descriptions on my 3D print designs

I needed a way to connect the main drive motor at the bottome of the ball
to the axle in the middle. To efficiently use the space bewteen these two
sections, I decided to place one of my batteries there in a casing which can
attach to the motor by a secondary bracket.

Version 1 used my squarish, USB power bank (5V), but I discovered it was too
wide to be able to place other mechanics nearby.  I used the same idea but
used my 12V battery instead in Version 2.  Version 1 was never printed.

The battery case was designed to be split in half and printed in two parts
so support was not needed.  In Version 2, I also removed unnecessary plastic
on the sides since they were a waste of material and print time.

These files were built with Autodesk 123Design, which is a free application.

Everything here is my own creation.
